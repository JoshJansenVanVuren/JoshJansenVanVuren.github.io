Currently a PhD student at Stellenbosch University. I form part of the DSP group in the Eletrical and Electronic department under the supervision of Thomas Niesler.
Currently working in code-switched speech recognition in under-resourced South African languages.
Interesting in all things deep learning, running, cycling, and triathlon.
